# Linux-Utils
A utility repository for various Linux-based configuration files and packages complete with scripts for syncing and installing these utilities.

The point of this is so that I don't have to constantly copy over changes and improvements I make to my various Linux environments, editors, shells, etc.  This way, I can clone the repository and then run the install script to automatically set up whatever configurations for the specified system I wish.

The sync script will be designed to push and pull various changes I've made to the different files, while preserving differences in installation based on operating system/preference.
